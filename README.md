# It's just my personal Dracula theme :))

# How to install it

Put this in your `init.lua`

```lua
use "datamonsterr/nvim-dracula"
```

# If you want to get the colors palete

`require "nvim-dracula.colors"`

# Ask me something?

Just create an issue whatever it is a question, bug or feature request.
